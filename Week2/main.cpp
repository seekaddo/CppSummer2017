/*\brief
 *
 * Input Format
 
 The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of
 (the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).
 Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦
 a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
 Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of
 (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.
 
 Constraints
 
 All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
 All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than
 Output Format
 
 For each pair of  and  values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer denoting
 the element located at index of the array referenced by . There should be a total of  lines of output.
